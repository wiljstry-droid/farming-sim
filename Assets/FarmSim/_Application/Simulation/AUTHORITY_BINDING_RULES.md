AUTHORITY BINDING DISCIPLINE (CANONICAL)

1. Authorities MUST declare dependencies explicitly.
2. Binding happens once, during bootstrap.
3. Missing or invalid dependencies MUST hard-fail.
4. No authority may silently substitute defaults.
5. Tick remains the sole executor of behavior.
6. Binding never causes simulation effects.

This document is normative.
