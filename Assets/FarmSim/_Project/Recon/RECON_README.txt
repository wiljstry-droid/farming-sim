RECON WORKFLOW (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

At the start of EVERY new chat:
1) Unity -> Tools -> Recon -> Export All
2) Upload the 3 newest JSON files to Ana.

These are the only accepted sources of project truth:
- recon_folder_tree_snapshot_*.json
- recon_script_index_snapshot_*.json
- recon_scene_hierarchy_snapshot_*.json

Do not proceed with implementation steps if exports are not current.
